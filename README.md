## Reflection

This project was created to showcase my knowledge with noSQL databases, It was also created to showcase my ability of making a application do CRUD(Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations.

I set out the build a web application that will allow a user to create a list of items they plan on achieving, I also set out to build the application in a way where the user would be able to delete items, create new list and have separate lists for different occasions.

The tools I used to build this project are HTML, CSS, Javascript, EJS, Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose, and MongoDB.
